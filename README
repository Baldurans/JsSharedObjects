Share objects in WebWorkers using SharedArrayBuffer

// setting up your structure
class MyArray extends SharedObjectArray<Uint32Array, MyObject> {
    constructor(buffer?: SharedArrayBuffer) {
        // 5 - max objects
        // 2 - size of an object
        super(5, 2, buffer);
    }
    protected createBlankObject(): MyObject {
        return new MyObject(null);
    }
    protected getTypedArray() {
        return Uint32Array;
    }
}
class MyObject extends MemoryObject<Uint32Array, MyArray> {
    constructor( something: number ) {
        super(() => {
            this.__setValueAt(0, 1);
            if( something !== null ) {
                this.something = something;
            }
        });
    }
    public set something(something: number) {
        this.__setValueAt(1, something);
    }
    public get something(): number {
        return this.__getValueAt(1);
    }
}

// in your main process
const arr1 = new MyArray();
arr1.add(new MyObject(1, 2));
arr1.add(new MyObject(5, 6));
arr1.add(new MyObject(7, 8));
arr1.set(4, new MyObject(9, 10));

// in web worker
const arr2 = new MyArray(arr1.getBuffer());
arr.forEach(( item ) => {

});


WEAKNESSES
* No atomic action protection. My use case assumed webWorkers only need to read, so didn't focus on this.
* A lot smaller limitations on how objects are handled. All of them were fine for my use case, but more advanced solution can be built.


CONCLUSION
Do what ever you want with it.

Thought it might be useful for someone to develop on top of this idea to make SharedArrayBuffer easier to use for a bit more complex cases than just sharing list of numbers.
I also did not find any library that would do something similar that would work in latest browsers.

Unfortunately I didn't have time to focus on this too much to make it a proper library... :(
